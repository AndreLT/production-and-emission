## Production and Emission
The ambition of this project is to give a reasonable perspective on worldwide and countrywide productions and emissions. Today the greater part of energy production derives from fossil fuels. With an increasing population(that is also getting richer), greater is the demand for electricity, food, transport, buildings and so on. All this processes are big emitors of greenhouse gases.
Using the data provided by ourworldindata.org we can have a good grasp on our current scenery.
